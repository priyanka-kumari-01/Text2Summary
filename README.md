# Text2Summary

Text-to-summary automatically generates concise summaries or synopses of longer texts, such as articles, documents, or web pages. It involves using natural language processing techniques and algorithms to analyze the input text, identify the most critical information, and condense it into a shorter form while preserving its essence. 

Text-to-summary systems aim to save time and effort by providing users with quick overviews of lengthy texts, enabling them to grasp the main points without reading the entire content. These systems can benefit news articles, research papers, or any text where a summary is desired for efficient information consumption.
